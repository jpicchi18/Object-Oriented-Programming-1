# Object Oriented Programming 1
Course projects for the UCLA course "Introduction to Computer Science I"

[Multi-Class "Pig" Board Game](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%207): Designed a virtual implementation of the board game "Pig", complete with score tallies, detection of winning conditions, turn changes, game resets, and other features.

[Auditorium Ticket Machine](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%205): Designed and implemented multiple classes that collectively perform the functions of an auditorium box office: selling tickets with different seat locations, showings, discounts, times, pricess, etc.

[Rowing Machine String Parsing](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%203): Implemented functions that receive strings of formatted data, verify the validity of the strings to ensure that they meet the formatting requirements, parse the segments of the strings, and return the separated components with proper formatting.

[Array Functions](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%204): Implemented common functions used to manipulate arrays whose components are strings (e.g. \["beta", "gamma", "delta"]). The functions I implemented include the following: detecting whether an array has duplicate values, finding the index of a particular value in an array, counting the number of numerical digits that appear in all entries, detecting whether or not the entires are in decreasing order, shifting the entries right by a specified number of entries, and replacing all occurances of a single character in all strings with some other character.

[UCLA Meal Plan Pricing](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%202): Developed a main routine to calculate the price of meals at UCLA's dining halls based on combinations of meal type, status of on-campus residence, and enrollment/employment status at UCLA.

[Exploring Error Types](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%201): Exploring the correspondence between different programming expressions and their resultant command line error messages.

[Learning About Pointers](https://github.com/jpicchi18/object_oriented_programming_1/tree/main/Project%206): Implemented various functions and rectified dereference errors associated with pointers.
